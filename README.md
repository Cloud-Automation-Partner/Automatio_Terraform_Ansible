# AWS Infrastructure Provisioning and Application Deployment with Terraform and Ansible

## Introduction

This README provides comprehensive documentation for an Infrastructure as Code (IAC) project that leverages Terraform and Ansible to create, configure, and deploy an AWS infrastructure, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and EC2 instances. Additionally, it details the process of migrating an existing Rails and Vue.js application running on a simple server to the IAC-based infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible, with Docker as the containerization solution.

## Project Overview

### Infrastructure Provisioning
- **Terraform**: The infrastructure provisioning phase utilizes Terraform to define and create the AWS resources. We automate the creation of a VPC, EC2 instances, and other necessary components.

### Application Deployment
- **Ansible**: Ansible is employed to configure the Linux servers within the EC2 instances, ensuring that Docker is installed and set up correctly. It is also responsible for deploying and managing the Rails and Vue.js-based application within Docker containers.
